## Principles

The Kyverno community adheres to the following principles:

- **Open**: The Kyverno community strives to be open, accessible and welcoming to everyone. Anyone may contribute, and contributions are available to all users according to open-source values and licenses.
- **Transparent and accessible**: Any changes to the Kyverno source code and collaborations on the project are publicly accessible (GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions).
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Code of Conduct

Kyverno follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is aligned with the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

## Vendor Neutrality

Kyverno follows the CNCF vendor neutrality guidelines documented at:

   https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/

## Meetings

Kyverno community meetings follow a defined [schedule](https://kyverno.io/community/#community-meetings).

The maintainers may also have closed meetings to discuss security reports or Code of Conduct (CoC) violations. Such meetings should be scheduled by any maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. All current Maintainers must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any maintainer who is accused of a CoC violation.

## Project Roles

The Kyverno community welcomes all contributors and has well-defined roles detailed below.

This document highlights the roles and responsibilities for the Kyverno community members. It also outlines the requirements for anyone who is looking to take on leadership roles in the Kyverno project. The following governance applies to all Kyverno subprojects.

**Note:** Please make sure to read the CNCF [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Contributor Ladder

Kyverno has defined a Contributor Ladder to recognize and promote contributors as they grow in involvement and impact. Each role is progressive, meaning that to move to the next level, a contributor must first have met the expectations of the previous level.

### Summary of Roles

The table below summarizes project roles and responsibilities. Details are provided in the sections following the table. Additionally, the roles used in this document are custom roles mapped according to the [GitHub roles and responsibilities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

Maintainers are individuals who have shown good technical judgement in feature design/development in the past. Maintainers have overall knowledge of the project and features in the project. They can read, clone, and push to the repository. They can also manage issues, pull requests, and some repository settings.

Maintainers are the technical authority for a subproject and are considered leaders for the organization as a whole. They must have demonstrated both good judgement and responsibility towards the health of the subproject. Maintainers must set technical direction and make or approve design decisions for their subproject, either directly or through delegation of these responsibilities. Unlike contributors, maintainers have the highest degree of responsibility and ownership for the project. Maintainer status may be subject to a vote and, if the minimum level of activity is not maintained, may be moved to an _emeritus_ status.

**On-boarding Criteria**

- Nominated by current Maintainer and voted in by a majority of current maintainers or raised in a PR by the proposed member to add themselves to `MAINTAINERS.md`, during a voting period lasting at least three (3) working days

**Off-boarding Criteria**

An off-boarding vote may be called by any maintainer if any of the following criteria are met:
- A maintainer has made less than 30 contributions over a span of 6 months.
  - Contributions can be tracked using the [DevStats dashboard](https://kyverno.devstats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%206%20months&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&from=1522810884223&to=1680577284223&var-companies=All).
  - Other relevant data will be collected and evaluated to assess the maintainer's contributions. This includes their involvement in discussions, conversations on Slack, and any other relevant interactions.

The off-boarding process includes the following steps:
- The off-boarding process is initiated by any currently active maintainer who conducts a review of the maintainers list and proceeds to initialize the off-boarding process if the above criteria are met.
- The plans of off-boarding process is sent in a private Slack message or email to the candidate.
- If the candidate for removal states plans to continue participating, another 6 months will be granted to the candidate to make contributions and the new cycle starts. No action is taken and this process terminates.
- If the candidate fails to meet the criteria during the second attempt to make contributions, the off-boarding process continues.
- A pull request (PR) proposing movement of the candidate is sent, initiating the public voting phase.
- The vote passes if a majority of current maintainers vote yes during a voting period lasting five (5) working days.
- A positive vote will result in movement to an _emeritus_ status within `MAINTAINERS.md` and removal from organization membership.

#### Progression Process

Progression to a new role requires an appointment or nomination by an existing Maintainer. All role appointments and nominations are subject to a vote.
- All role appointments, nominations, and votes must be documented in a GitHub issue or pull request
- Contributions across any Kyverno sub-projects count toward progression. The list of acceptable contributions is listed above.

#### Benefits of the Contributor Ladder

The Contribution Ladder is meant to provide clear expectations and transparency for how to grow within the project and ensure that all contributors are recognized for their efforts, commitment, and support of our community ensuring contributor growth and project sustainability.

#### Mapping Project Roles to GitHub Roles

The roles used in this document are custom roles mapped according to the [GitHub roles and responsibilities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

| Project Role       | GitHub Role    |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| New Contributor    | None           |
| Contributor        | None           |
| Reviewer           | Write          |
| Maintainer         | Maintain       |

### Off-boarding Guidance

If any of the above roles hasn't contributed in any phases (including, but not limited to: code changes, doc updates, issue discussions) in 3 months, the administrator needs to inform the member and remove one's roles and GitHub permissions.

## Maintainer Areas

The Kyverno projects code base cover many areas and project maintainers are not required to know everything about a project.
For this reason, maintainers can be specific to one (or more) area of the code base, every area representing a specific aspect.

## Kyverno Steering & Oversight Committee (KSOC)

The full bylaws and membership structure of the Kyverno Steering & Oversight Committee (KSOC) are documented in the dedicated KSOC governance file:

👉 [KYVERNO_STEERING_OVERSIGHT_COMMITTEE.md](./KYVERNO_STEERING_OVERSIGHT_COMMITTEE.md)


## Conflict Resolutions

Typically, it is assumed that disputes will be resolved amicably by those involved. However, if the situation becomes more serious, conflicts will be resolved through a voting process. A supermajority of votes from project maintainers is required to make a decision, and the project lead has the final say in the ruling.

## Changes

This Project Governance is a living document. All key project changes including changes in project governance can be proposed by a GitHub PR and then reviewed and voted on by project maintainers.
